 In a competition creatures are competing. There are three kind of creatures: sandwalker, sponge, wanderer. The competition takes a few days. The days can be sunny, cloudy or rainy. The single creatures react differently on the day types regarding their water consumption and moving. These datas are given in the following table:

Kind	Water consumption	Moving	Max. water
 	sunny	cloudy	rainy	sunny	cloudy	rainy	 
SandWalker	-1	0	3	3	1	0	8
Sponge	-4	-1	6	0	1	3	20
Wanderer	-2	-1	3	1	2	1	12
The datas have to be read from a file of which the format is the following:

Steve sandwalker 4
Pete wanderer 7

The last line of the file contains the days:

Create a Creature class of which the members are the name, type and actual water of the creature. These members should have private visibility.
The name, type and starting water can be provided in the constructor.
Create a method which expects a day type (char) as parameter, and makes the creature step according to the day and creature type. If the creature runs out of water then it dies. Only living creatures can move.
Create creatures according to the input file and store them in a vector. Make the creatures step based on the days which is also stored in the file.
Create a function which expects the vector of creatures as parameter and returns the furthermost living creature.
The task is to print the name of the living creature which got the furthest.
